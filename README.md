## Game Description ##
The objective of the game is to grab the key and use it to open the door on each
level while also collecting as much treasure as possible along the way. The
player must also avoid enemies, and touching said enemies will cause the player
character to die. It is possible (but difficult) to jump over enemies. Enemies 
will pursue the player character to the last reachable destination that the
player was located. Enemies are not capable of jumping or falling off of
platforms. Much of the gameplay is based on outsmarting the enemy AI and
exploiting its behavior.


## Cheat Codes ##
The equals/plus key next to zero on the keyboard (not numpad) will make the game
advance to the next level.

## Low-Bar Goals Completed ##
My low bar goals were:

 * Two or three playable levels (completed)
 
 * Player should be present and capable of navigating levels (completed)
 
 * Should be collectible treasure on each map (completed)
 
 * Should be a key and an exit door on every level (completed)
 
 * At least "dumb" enemies should be implemented (completed, enemies are
   actually "smart" though, see high bar goals)

 * At least one kind of item the player can use (technically completed, as keys
   are usable items, but was really hoping for weapon item)
 
 * The player should be able to jump (completed)
 
 * Basic menu screen with basic level progression (completed)

Thus, all low bar goals were completed, with one possible exception being having
at least one usable item. As stated, I was hoping to have an item that could be
used against the enemies.


## High-Bar Goals Completed ##
The high-bar goals that I completed were:

 * Different themes/tilesets for levels (complete)
 
 * Functioning "hunter" AI that allows enemies to chase/hunt player (complete)
 

## Other Items Completed ##
 * Game window can scale to any resolution above 640x480 and maintain scaling
   that doesn't make the pixel art look bad (I thought this was cool anyway)
