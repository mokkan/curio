## Curio ##
The objective of the game is to grab the key and use it to open the door on each
level while also collecting as much treasure as possible along the way. The
player must also avoid enemies, and touching said enemies will cause the player
character to die. It is possible (but difficult) to jump over enemies. Enemies 
will pursue the player character to the last reachable destination that the
player was located. Enemies are not capable of jumping or falling off of
platforms. Much of the gameplay is based on outsmarting the enemy AI and
exploiting its behavior.
